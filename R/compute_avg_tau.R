#' Compute Average tau
#'
#' @description Calculates the average tau correlation coefficient defined by Emond and Mason (2002).
#' The average tau correlation has a one-to-one relationship with total Kemeny distance,
#' While it is more common, total Kemeny distance may be preferred to avoid rounding error.
#'
#' @param total_K a positive integer as the total Kemeny distance of a ranking versus
#' the input rankings.
#'
#' @param n a positive integer for the number of objects in the ranking.
#'
#' @param k a positive integer for the number of judges or attributes in the given
#' ranking problem. This is also the number of input rankings from the problem.
